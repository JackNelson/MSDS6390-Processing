The following repository houses the assignments and projects generated from the MSDS6390 course at Southern Methodist University for the Masters of Data Science Program.  All assignments were done using a java-based environment called Processing3.  Each folder contains an assignment for that week along with any supporting documents generated (i.e. user-built tools, image jpegs, etc.).  Each folder will contain its own READ.md file explaining the assignment and the folder contents.  The assignments are as follows:

**Assignment 1: Painting Re-creation**
**Assignment 2: Self Portrait**
