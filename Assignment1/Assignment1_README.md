**Pixel\_Finder\_Tool/Pixel\_Finder\_Tool.pde** 
 
The purpose of this tool is it to find the coordinates and RGB values of pixels within an image.  It uses an image url address to resize the screen in Processing and display it as the background.  White coordinate lines are displayed to assist the user in pixel location.  The color of the pixel is also enlarged for clarity.  X and Y coordinate values along with the RGB values are shown next to the cursor.  Clicking on a given pixel will take a 10x10 pixel swatch with the cursor at the upper right corner of the swatch.  Average RGB values and standard deviations of the RGB values are printed on the command prompt.  The X and Y coordinates and their proportion of the width and height are printed as well. 

**Masks\_Sketch/Masks\_Sketch.pde**  

This file regenerates one of the illustrations in the "Masks" collection by Ben Newman.   The file creates the illustration in 4 sections: Top, Middle, Bottom, and Face.  Numerous loop algorithms are uses to regenerate repetitive patterns in sections and to mirror patterns.  All calculations were done as proportions of the height and width if changes in size dimensions are desired.
